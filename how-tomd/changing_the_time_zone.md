# Changing the Time Zone

/etc/sysconfig/clock

The /etc/sysconfig/clock file controls the interpretation of values read from the system hardware clock.

The correct values are:

**UTC**=, where  is one of the following boolean values: true or yes — The hardware clock is set to Universal Time. false or no — The hardware clock is set to local time.

**ARC**=, where  is the following: false or no — This value indicates that the normal UNIX epoch is in use. Other values are used by systems not supported by Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

**SRM**=, where  is the following: false or no — This value indicates that the normal UNIX epoch is in use. Other values are used by systems not supported by Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

**ZONE**= — The time zone file under /usr/share/zoneinfo that **/etc/localtime** is a copy of. The file contains information such as:

```text
ZONE="America/New York"
```

Note that the ZONE parameter is read by the Time and Date Properties Tool \(system-config-date\), and manually editing it does not change the system timezone. Earlier releases of Red Hat Enterprise Linux used the following values \(which are deprecated\):

CLOCKMODE=, where  is one of the following: GMT — The clock is set to Universal Time \(Greenwich Mean Time\). ARC — The ARC console's 42-year time offset is in effect \(for Alpha-based systems only\).

Create a symbolic link between /etc/localtime and your time zone file so that the instance finds the time zone file when it references local time information.

```text
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York /etc/localtime
```
