# How-To Creating a Partition Size Larger Than 2TB

Linux GPT Kernel Support

EFI GUID Partition support works on both 32bit and 64bit platforms. You must include GPT support in kernel in order to use GPT. If you don't include GPT support in Linux kernelt, after rebooting the server, the file system will no longer be mountable or the GPT table will get corrupted. By default Redhat Enterprise Linux / CentOS comes with GPT kernel support. However, if you are using Debian or Ubuntu Linux, you need to recompile the kernel. Set CONFIG\_EFI\_PARTITION to y to compile this feature.

Find Out Current Disk Size

Type the following command:

```text
# fdisk -l /dev/sdb
```

Sample outputs:

```text
Disk /dev/sdb: 3000.6 GB, 3000592982016 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 364801 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disk identifier: 0x00000000
Disk /dev/sdb doesn't contain a valid partition table
```

Linux Create 3TB partition size

To create a partition start GNU parted as follows:

```text
# parted /dev/sdb
```

Output:

```text
GNU Parted 2.3
Using /dev/sdb
Welcome to GNU Parted! Type 'help' to view a list of commands.
(parted)
```

Creates a new GPT disklabel i.e. partition table:

```text
(parted) mklabel gpt
```

Sample outputs:

```text
Warning: The existing disk label on /dev/sdb will be destroyed and all data on this disk will be lost. Do you want to continue?
Yes/No? yes
(parted)
```

Next, set the default unit to TB, enter:

```text
(parted) unit TB
```

To create a 3TB partition size, enter:

```text
(parted) mkpart primary 0 0
```

OR

```text
(parted) mkpart primary 0.00TB 3.00TB
```

To print the current partitions, enter:

```text
(parted) print
```

Sample outputs:

```text
Model: ATA ST33000651AS (scsi)
Disk /dev/sdb: 3.00TB
Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
Partition Table: gpt
Number  Start   End     Size    File system  Name     Flags
 1      0.00TB  3.00TB  3.00TB  ext4         primary
```

Quit and save the changes, enter:

```text
(parted) quit
```

Sample outputs:

```text
Information: You may need to update /etc/fstab.
```

Use the mkfs.ext3 or mkfs.ext4 command to format the file system, enter:

```text
# mkfs.ext3 /dev/sdb1
```

OR

```text
# mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1
```

Sample outputs:

```text
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1

```

Type the following commands to mount /dev/sdb1, enter:

```text
# mkdir /data
# mount /dev/sdb1 /data
# df -H
```

Sample outputs:

```text
Filesystem             Size   Used  Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sdc1               16G   819M    14G   6% /
tmpfs                  1.6G      0   1.6G   0% /lib/init/rw
udev                   1.6G   123k   1.6G   1% /dev
tmpfs                  1.6G      0   1.6G   0% /dev/shm
/dev/sdb1              3.0T   211M   2.9T   1% /data
```

Make sure you replace /dev/sdb1 with actual RAID or Disk name or Block Ethernet device such as /dev/etherd/e0.0. Do not forget to update /etc/fstab, if necessary. Also note that booting from a GPT volume requires support in your BIOS / firmware. This is not supported on non-EFI platforms. I suggest you boot server from another disk such as IDE / SATA / SSD disk and store data on /data.
