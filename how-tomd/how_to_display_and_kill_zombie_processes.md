# How to display and kill zombie processes

Zombie processes are undead, scary killing them isn't so easy

## finding if zombies exist

* execute the top command
* one line is tasks:
  * Example output: Tasks: 63 total, 1 running, 61 sleeping, 0 stopped, 1 zombie

## Who is zombie

* execute:

  ```text
  ps aux | awk '"[Zz]" ~ $8 { printf("%s, PID = %d\n", $8, $2); }'
  ```

* example output is zombie process status, process ID: Z+, PID = 5067

## Kill the zombies

zombies are living dead, so the aren't always easy to kill.

* Try executing: kill -9 PID

  example: kill -9 5067

* See is the zombie is still alive, undead

  use the techniques above

* If its still undead

  get a cross or garlic, well reliable sources tell me the don't work. We must try something else

* Kill the zombie's parent \(process\)
* execute: ps ef
  * this will display a process \(family\) tree
  * find the command who is the PID matches the zombie then look at the parents and try killing them
* example:

  5060 pts/1    S+     0:00 /usr/libexec/gconfd-2 13 MANPATH=/usr/local/share/man
  ```

* netstat matches the PID above, 5067
  * so in this example I would try killing
    * 5030 pts/1 Sl+ 1:29 /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/
    * 4978 tty1 S 0:00 xterm -e /home/zymos/.icewm/startup M

      Or

    * 4986 pts/1 Ss+ 0:00 /bin/sh /home/zymos/.icewm/startu
* Hopefully this will work
* If you need a  single line command that does the work you can try

  ```text
  ps axu | awk '"[Zz] ~ $8 { system(sprintf("kill -HUP %d", $2)); }'
  ```

* This will work in most cases
  * Check if the zombie process still exists; if so, run the same command but change -HUP to -TERM.
  * If the zombie is still there, use -9 instead of -HUP or -TERM.
    * -9 will terminate it for sure but it's considered very bad practice
