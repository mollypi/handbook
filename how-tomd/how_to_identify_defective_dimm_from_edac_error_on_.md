# How to identify defective DIMM from EDAC error on Linux

DIMM error is rare, but sometime still happens. It's easy to identify them if they are completely dead, however, if a DIMM has some corrected errors, how to identify it?

I have another article listed memory testing tools on linux, this time, I use EDAC error report utility

Here is an example show you how to identify defective DIMM on an AMD\_x64 archtecture machine, syslog reorted kernel error from EDAC \(Error Detection and Correction kernel module\).

Here is a piece of typical error message from EDAC

```text
kernel: [Hardware Error]: MC4 Error (node 1): DRAM ECC error detected on the NB.
kernel: EDAC amd64 MC1: CE ERROR_ADDRESS= 0xf075b2410
kernel: EDAC MC1: CE page 0xf075b2, offset 0x410, grain 0, syndrome 0xa082, row 6, channel 0, label "": amd64_edac
kernel: [Hardware Error]: Error Status: Corrected error, no action required.
kernel: [Hardware Error]: CPU:6 (10:8:0) MC4_STATUS[-|CE|MiscV|-|AddrV|CECC]: 0x9c414000a0080813
kernel: [Hardware Error]: MC4_ADDR: 0x0000000f075b2410
kernel: [Hardware Error]: cache level: L3/GEN, mem/io: MEM, mem-tx: RD, part-proc: SRC (no timeout)
```

You may get confused by the message above, here is a quick way to show you what are they:

The structure of the message is:

```text
 the memory controller                   (MC1)
 Error type                              (CE)

 offset in the page                      (0x410)
 The byte granularity                    (grain 0)
 The error syndrome                      (0xb741)

```

## More explain about info given

EDAC is composed of a "core" module \(edac\_core.ko\) and several Memory Controller \(MC\) driver modules. On a given system, the CORE is loaded and one MC driver will be loaded. Both the CORE and the MC driver \(or edac\_device driver\) have individual versions that reflect current release level of their respective modules. Thus, to "report" on what version a system is running, one must report both the CORE's and the MC driver's versions.

The example server I used in this article has these two edac module loaded:

```text
# lsmod | grep -i edac
amd64_edac_mod         21913  0 
edac_core              46645  4 amd64_edac_mod
edac_mce_amd           15615  1 amd64_edac_mod
```

**Memory Controller \(mc\) Model**, the memory controller's model abstracted in EDAC. Each 'mc' device controls a set of DIMM memory modules. These modules are laid out in a Chip-Select Row \(csrowX\) and Channel table \(chX\).

There can be multiple csrows and multiple channels. Memory controllers allow for several csrows, with 8 csrows being a typical value.

**Channel**, each channel represents a DIMM module. Dual channels allows for 128 bit data transfers to the CPU from memory. Some system supports more channels.

**Csrow**, Chip-Select Row, shows how memory module assembled, single or dual rank or more, the actual number of csrows depends on the electrical "loading" of a given motherboard, memory controller and DIMM characteristics.

For single rank DIMM module, a pair of DIMMs merge into one csrow, typically, you will see only csrow0, while csrow1 will be empty.

Use edac-util tool to identify

## Check MC info and status

```text
# edac-util -vs
edac-util: EDAC drivers are loaded. 2 MCs detected:
  mc0:F10h
  mc1:F10h
```

## Check EDAC error report by edac-util tool

mc1: csrow6: 0 Uncorrected Errors
mc1: csrow6: ch0: 7 Corrected Errors
mc1: csrow6: ch1: 0 Corrected Errors
mc1: csrow7: 0 Uncorrected Errors
mc1: csrow7: ch0: 0 Corrected Errors
mc1: csrow7: ch1: 0 Corrected Errors
```

This is consistent with the error what we saw in the syslog, same information can also be found in /sys/devices/system/edac/mc/mc\[0\|1\]

```text
# ls /sys/devices/system/edac/mc/mc1
ce_count     csrow0  csrow2  csrow4  csrow6  device   reset_counters    seconds_since_reset  ue_count
ce_noinfo_count  csrow1  csrow3  csrow5  csrow7  mc_name  sdram_scrub_rate  size_mb         ue_noinfo_count
```

## Info Analysis

So, according to above info we get, we can tell the server has two memory controllers, 8 pairs of dual ranked memory modules.

As we know the memory error located at

```text
mc1: csrow6: ch0: 7 Corrected Errors
```

What it tells us is the physical DIMM:

```text
In the second memory controller(mc1).
Fourth pair of DIMM (csrow6 and csrow7)
ch0 tells it's the first DIMM in the DIMM pair.
```

Use the info above, you can easily find it according the hardware info of the server\(usually you can find the motherboard articheture map\)

## Another way of locating the defective DIMM\(May not work on some systems \)

Use dmidecode to show each memory module's address, see more dmidecode examples

```text
#dmidecode -t 20
Handle 0x0058, DMI type 20, 19 bytes
Memory Device Mapped Address
    Starting Address: 0x00F00000000
    Ending Address: 0x00FFFFFFFFF
    Range Size: 4 GB
    Physical Device Handle: 0x0057
    Memory Array Mapped Address Handle: 0x0038
    Partition Row Position: 2
    Interleave Position: 2
```

Use the memory error address reported in syslog to locate the defective DIMM.

```text
kernel: EDAC amd64 MC1: CE ERROR_ADDRESS= 0xf075b2410
```
