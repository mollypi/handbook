## free command examples

This command is used to display the free, used, swap memory available in the system.

```text
$ free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:       3566408    1580220    1986188          0     203988     902960
-/+ buffers/cache:     473272    3093136
Swap:      4000176          0    4000176
```

If you want to quickly check how many GB of RAM your system has use the -g option. -b option displays in bytes, -k in kilo bytes, -m in mega bytes.

```text
$ free -g
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:             3          1          1          0          0          0
-/+ buffers/cache:          0          2
Swap:            3          0          3
```

If you want to see a total memory \( including the swap\), use the -t switch, which will display a total line as shown below.

```text
ramesh@ramesh-laptop:~$ free -t
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached

-/+ buffers/cache:     475332    3091076
Swap:      4000176          0    4000176

Select sort field via field letter, type any other key to return

  a: PID        = Process Id              v: nDRT       = Dirty Pages count
  d: UID        = User Id                 y: WCHAN      = Sleeping in Function
  e: USER       = User Name               z: Flags      = Task Flags
