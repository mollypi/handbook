# FDISK

Following are the 5 typical actions \(commands\) that you can execute inside fdisk.

* n – New Partition creation
* d – Delete an existing partition
* p - Print Partition Table
* w – Write the changes to the partition table. i.e save.
* q – Quit the fdisk utility

Create a partition In the following example, I created a /dev/sda1 primary partition.

```text
# fdisk /dev/sda Command (m for help): p
Disk /dev/sda: 287.0 GB, 287005343744 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 34893 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes
Device Boot  Start   End      Blocks   Id  System
Command (m for help): n Command action
e extended
p   primary partition (1-4)
p

Last cylinder or +size or +sizeM or +sizeK (1-34893,

Command (m for help): w
