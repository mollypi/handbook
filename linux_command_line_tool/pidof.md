# PIDOF

pidof = find the process ID of a running program

Pidof finds the process id's \(pids\) of the named programs. It prints those id's on the standard output. This program is on some systems used in run-level change scripts, especially when the system has a System-V like rc structure.

```text
sysadmin@codewarden:~$ pidof apache2
5098 5095 5094 5092
```

pgrep = look up or signal processes based on name and other attributes, pgrep looks through the currently running processes and lists the process IDs which matches the selection criteria.

```text
sysadmin@codewarden:~$ pgrep apache2
5092
5094
5095
5098
```

pgrep, \(p\) = process, grep = grep prints the matching lines

How-To: Kill a Process Using the 'pidof' Command If a process hangs and you want to easily kill it, type in a console:

```text
kill -9 $(pidof process_name)
```

And replace process\_name with a currently running process. For example, to kill Amarok you would issue the following:

```text
kill -9 $(pidof amarokapp)
```

Or Banshee, as another example:

```text
kill -9 $(pidof banshee)
```

Or

```text
kill -9 $(pidof banshee-1)
```

pidof is a command that finds the process ID \(PID\) of a given application. What is inside the \( and \) parenthesis is replaced with a certain PID, and the process which has that PID will be killed.
