# SED

When you copy a DOS file to Unix, you could find \r\n in the end of each line. This example converts the DOS file format to Unix file format using sed command.

Syntax:

* s is substitute command
* / is a delimiter
* REGEXP is regular expression to match
* REPLACEMENT is a value to replace

  FLAGS can be any of the following :

* g Replace all the instance of REGEXP with REPLACEMENT
* n Could be any number,replace nth instance of the REGEXP with REPLACEMENT.
* p If substitution was made, then prints the new pattern space.
* i match REGEXP in a case-insensitive manner.
* w file If substitution was made, write out the result to the given file.
* We can use different delimiters \( one of @ % ; : \) instead of /

```text
$sed 's/.$//' filename
```

Print file content in reverse order

```text
$ sed -n '1!G;h;$p' thegeekstuff.txt
```

Add line number for all non-empty-lines in a file

```text
$ sed '/./=' thegeekstuff.txt | sed 'N; s/\n/ /'
```

```text
$ sed 's/Linux/Linux-Unix/g' thegeekstuff.txt
