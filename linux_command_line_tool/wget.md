The following example downloads a single file from internet and stores in the current directory.

```text

  bytes as shown below\)

Download and Store With a Different File name Using wget -O By default wget will pick the filename from the last word after last forward slash, which may not be appropriate always.

```text
$ wget -O taglist.zip
http://www.vim.org/scripts/download_script.php?src_id=7701
```

Continue the Incomplete Download Using wget -c Restart a download which got stopped in the middle using wget -c option as shown below.

```text
$ wget -c http://www.openss7.org/repos/tarballs/strx25-
0.9.2.1.tar.bz2
```

This is very helpful when you have initiated a very big file download which got interrupted in the middle. Instead of starting the whole download again, you can start the download from where it got interrupted using option -c

Note: If a download is stopped in middle, when you restart the download again without the option -c, wget will append .1 to the filename automatically as a file with the previous name already exist. If a file with .1 already exist, it will download the file with .2 at the end.

Download Multiple Files / URLs Using Wget -i

```text
$ wget -i download-file-list.txt
```
