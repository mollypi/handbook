# YUM

## Install a package using yum install

To install a package, do ‘yum install packagename’. This will also identify the dependencies automatically and install them. The following example installs postgresql package.

```text
# yum install postgresql.x86_64
Resolving Dependencies
Install       2 Package(s)

Installing : postgresql-9.0.4-5.fc15.x86_64       2/2
```

## Uninstall a package using yum remove

To remove a package \(along with all its dependencies\), use ‘yum remove package’ as shown below.

```text
# yum remove  postgresql.x86_64
Package postgresql.x86_64 0:9.0.4-5.fc15 will be erased
Is this ok [y/N]: y
Running Transaction
  Erasing    : postgresql-9.0.4-5.fc15.x86_64       1/1
```

## Upgrade an existing package using yum update

If you have a older version of a package, use ‘yum update package’ to upgrade it to the latest current version. This will also identify and install all required dependencies.

```text
# yum update postgresql.x86_64
```

Search for a package to be installed using yum search If you don’t know the exact package name to be installed, use ‘yum search keyword’, which will search all the packages that matches the ‘keyword’ and display it. The following examples searches the yum repository for all the packages that matches the keyword ‘firefox’ and lists the available packages.

```text
# yum search firefox
Loaded plugins: langpacks, presto, refresh-packagekit
============== N/S Matched: firefox ======================
firefox.x86_64 : Mozilla Firefox Web browser
gnome-do-plugins-firefox.x86_64
mozilla-firetray-firefox.x86_64
mozilla-adblockplus.noarch : Mozilla Firefox extension
mozilla-noscript.noarch : Mozilla Firefox extension
```

Name and summary matches only, use "search all" for everything.

## Display additional information about a package using yum info

Once you search for a package using yum search, you can use ‘yum info package’ to view additional information about the package.

The following examples displays additional information about the samba-common package.

```text
# yum info samba-common.i686
Loaded plugins: langpacks, presto, refresh-packagekit
Available Packages
Name        : samba-common

URL         : http://www.samba.org/
License     : GPLv3+ and LGPLv3+
Description : Samba-common provides files necessary for
both the server and client
```

## View all available packages using yum list

The following command will list all the packages available in the yum database.

```text
# yum list | less
```

## List only the installed packages using yum list installed

## To view all the packages that are installed on your system, execute the following yum command.

```text
# yum list installed | less
```

## Which package does a file belong to? – Use yum provides

Use ‘yum provides’ if you like to know which package a particular file belongs to. For example, if you like to know the name of the package that has the /etc/sysconfig/nfs file, do the following.

```text
# yum provides /etc/sysconfig/nfs
Loaded plugins: langpacks, presto, refresh-packagekit
1:nfs-utils-1.2.3-10.fc15.x86_64 : NFS utilities and supporting clients and

                                : daemons for the kernel NFS server
Repo        : updates
Matched from:

Repo        : installed
Matched from:
Other       : Provides-match: /etc/sysconfig/nfs
```

## List available software groups using yum grouplist

In yum, several related packages are grouped together in a specific group. Instead of searching and installing all the individual packages that belongs to a specific function, you can simply install the group, which will install all the packages that belongs to the group.

To view all the available software groups execute ‘yum grouplist’ as shown below. The output is listed in three groups–Installed Groups, Installed Language Groups and Available Groups.

```text
# yum grouplist

Installed Groups:
   Administration Tools
   Base
   Design Suite
   ....

Installed Language Groups:
   Arabic Support [ar]
   Armenian Support [hy]
   Bengali Support [bn]
   ....

Available Groups:
   Authoring and Publishing
   Books and Guides
   Clustering
   DNS Name Server
   Development Libraries
   Development Tools
   Directory Server
   Dogtag Certificate System
   ...
```

## Install a specific software group using yum groupinstall

To install specific software group, use groupinstall option as shown below. In the following example, ‘DNS Name Server’ group contains bind and bind-chroot.

```text
# yum groupinstall 'DNS Name Server'

Note: You can also install MySQL database using yum groupinstall as we discussed earlier.

11. Upgrade an existing software group using groupupdate

If you’ve already installed a software group using yum groupinstall, and would like to upgrade it to the latest version, use ‘yum groupupdate’ as shown below.

# yum groupupdate 'Graphical Internet'

## Display your current yum repositories

All yum commands goes against one or more yum repositories. To view all the yum repositories that are configured in your system, do "yum repolist" as shown below.

The following will display only the enabled repositories.

```text
# yum repolist
repo id     repo name                        status
fedora      Fedora 15 - x86_64               24,085
updates     Fedora 15 - x86_64 - Updates     5,612
To display all the repositories (both enabled and disabled), use ‘yum repolist all’.
```

```text
# yum repolist all

```

## To view only the disabled repositories, use

```text
# yum repositories disabled’.
```

## Install from a disabled repositories using yum –enablerepo

By default yum installs only from the enabled repositories. For some reason if you like to install a package from a disabled repositories, use –enablerepo option in the ‘yum install’ as shown below.

```text
# yum --enablerepo=fedora-source install vim-X11.x86_64

## Execute yum commands interactively using Yum Shell

Yum provides the interactive shell to run multiple commands as shown below.

```text
# yum shell
Setting up Yum Shell

Yum can also read commands from a text file and execute it one by one. This is very helpful when you have multiple systems. Instead of executing the same command on all the systems, create a text file with those commands, and use ‘yum shell’ to execute those commands as shown below.

# cat yum_cmd.txt
repolist
info nfs-utils-lib.x86_64

# yum shell yum_cmd.txt 
repo id     repo name                        status
fedora      Fedora 15 - x86_64               24,085

Leaving Shell
```

eliminates all files that yum uses to determine the remote availability of packages. These metadata are downloaded again the next time yum is run.

```bash
yum clean metadata
```

To see which installed packages on your system have updates available, use the following command:

```bash
yum check-update
```

```text
For example:
~]# yum check-update

yum.noarch                         3.2.24-4.el6               rhel
```

The packages in the above output are listed as having updates available. The first package in the list is PackageKit, the graphical package manager. The line in the example output tells us:

**PackageKit** — the name of the package

**x86\_64** — the CPU architecture the package was built for

**0.5.8** — the version of the updated package to be installed

**rhel** — the repository in which the updated package is located

The output also shows us that we can update the kernel \(the kernel package\), Yum and RPM themselves \(the yum and rpm packages\), as well as their dependencies \(such as the kernel-firmware, rpm-libs, and rpm-python packages\), all using yum.

The yum --showduplicates list package command doesn’t limit packages to their latest versions in the info, list and search commands.

```bash
yum --showduplicates list package_name
```
