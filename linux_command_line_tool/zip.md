# zip

The command is tottally compatible with PKZIP \(Phil Katz's ZIP for MSDOS systems\). The zip command is pretty good for packaging a set of files for distribution and/or for archiving files; and for saving disk space by temporarily compressing unused files or directories.

Simple Examples

The syntax is as follows:

```text
zip file.zip file1.txt file2.doc photo.jpg
```

To zip resume.doc and all \*.c file, enter:

```text
zip bacup.zip resume.doc *.c
```

To zip data directory, enter:

```text
zip -r backup.zip data
```
