# Ethernet Bonding modes

## Descriptions of bonding modes

**Mode 0 balance-rr**

Round-robin policy: Transmit packets in sequential order from the first available slave through the last. This mode provides load balancing and fault tolerance.

**Mode 1 active-backup**

Active-backup policy: Only one slave in the bond is active. A different slave becomes active if, and only if, the active slave fails. The bond's MAC address is externally visible on only one port \(network adapter\) to avoid confusing the switch. This mode provides fault tolerance. The primary option affects the behavior of this mode.

**Mode 2 balance-xor**

XOR policy: Transmit based on selectable hashing algorithm. The default policy is a simple source+destination MAC address algorithm. Alternate transmit policies may be selected via the xmit\_hash\_policy option, described below. This mode provides load balancing and fault tolerance.

Mode 3 broadcast

Broadcast policy: transmits everything on all slave interfaces. This mode provides fault tolerance.

**Mode 4 802.3ad**

IEEE 802.3ad Dynamic link aggregation. Creates aggregation groups that share the same speed and duplex settings. Utilizes all slaves in the active aggregator according to the 802.3ad specification.

Prerequisites:

Ethtool support in the base drivers for retrieving the speed and duplex of each slave. A switch that supports IEEE 802.3ad Dynamic link aggregation. Most switches will require some type of configuration to enable 802.3ad mode.

**Mode 5 balance-tlb**

Adaptive transmit load balancing: channel bonding that does not require any special switch support. The outgoing traffic is distributed according to the current load \(computed relative to the speed\) on each slave. Incoming traffic is received by the current slave. If the receiving slave fails, another slave takes over the MAC address of the failed receiving slave.

Prerequisites:

Ethtool support in the base drivers for retrieving the speed of each slave.

**Mode 6 balance-alb**

Adaptive load balancing: includes balance-tlb plus receive load balancing \(rlb\) for IPV4 traffic, and does not require any special switch support. The receive load balancing is achieved by ARP negotiation. The bonding driver intercepts the ARP Replies sent by the local system on their way out and overwrites the source hardware address with the unique hardware address of one of the slaves in the bond such that different peers use different hardware addresses for the server.

## Descriptions of balancing algorithm modes

The balancing algorithm is set with the **xmit\_hash\_policy** option.

Possible values are:

**layer2** Uses XOR of hardware MAC addresses to generate the hash. This algorithm will place all traffic to a particular network peer on the same slave.

**layer2+3** Uses XOR of hardware MAC addresses and IP addresses to generate the hash. This algorithm will place all traffic to a particular network peer on the same slave.

**layer3+4** This policy uses upper layer protocol information, when available, to generate the hash. This allows for traffic to a particular network peer to span multiple slaves, although a single connection will not span multiple slaves.

**encap2+3** This policy uses the same formula as layer2+3 but it relies on skb\_flow\_dissect to obtain the header fields which might result in the use of inner headers if an encapsulation protocol is used.

**encap3+4** This policy uses the same formula as layer3+4 but it relies on skb\_flow\_dissect to obtain the header fields which might result in the use of inner headers if an encapsulation protocol is used.

The default value is layer2. This option was added in bonding version 2.6.3. In earlier versions of bonding, this parameter does not exist, and the layer2 policy is the only policy. The layer2+3 value was added for bonding version 3.2.2.
