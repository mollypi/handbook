# Signals

The simplest and crudest way for two processes on the same machine to communicate with each other is for one to send the other a signal. **Unix signals are a form of soft interrupt**; each one has a default effect on the receiving process \(usually to kill it\). A process can declare a signal handler that overrides the default action for the signal; **the handler is a function that is executed asynchronously when the signal is received.**

Signals were originally designed into Unix as a way for the operating system to notify programs of certain errors and critical events, not as an IPC facility. The SIGHUP signal, for example, is sent to every program started from a given terminal session when that session is terminated. The SIGINT signal is sent to whatever process is currently attached to the keyboard when the user enters the currently-defined interrupt character \(often control-C\). Nevertheless, signals can be useful for some IPC situations \(and the POSIX-standard signal set includes two signals, SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2, intended for this use\). They are often employed as a control channel for daemons \(programs that run constantly, invisibly, in background\), a way for an operator or another program to tell a daemon that it needs to either reinitialize itself, wake up to do work, or write internal-state/debugging information to a known location.

**A technique often used with signal IPC is the so-called pidfile. Programs that will need to be signaled will write a small file to a known location \(often in /var/run or the invoking user’s home directory\) containing their process ID or PID. Other programs can read that file to discover that PID. The pidfile may also function as an implicit lock file in cases where no more than one instance of the daemon should be running simultaneously.**

There are actually two different flavors of signals. In the older implementations \(notably V7, System III, and early System V\), the handler for a given signal is reset to the default for that signal whenever the handler fires. The result of sending two of the same signal in quick succession is therefore usually to kill the process, no matter what handler was set.

The BSD 4.x versions of Unix changed to “reliable” signals, which do not reset unless the user explicitly requests it. They also introduced primitives to block or temporarily suspend processing of a given set of signals. Modern Unixes support both styles. You should use the BSD-style nonresetting entry points for new code, but program defensively in case your code is ever ported to an implementation that does not support them.

ReceivingNsignalsdoesnotnecessarilyinvokethesignalhandlerNtimes. UndertheolderSystem V signal model, two or more signals spaced very closely together \(that is, within a single timeslice of the target process\) can result in various race conditions75 or anomalies. Depending on what variant of signals semantics the system supports, the second and later instances may be ignored, may cause an unexpected process kill, or may have their delivery delayed until earlier instances have been processed \(on modern Unixes the last is most likely\).

The modern signals API is portable across all recent Unix versions, but not to Windows or classic \(pre-OS X\) MacOS.

A signal is an asynchronous event which is delivered to a process.

1. Asynchronous means that the event can occur at any time
   * may be unrelated to the execution of the process
   * e.g. user types ctrl-C, or the modem hangs
2. Unix supports a signal facility, looks like a software version of the interrupt subsystem of a

   normal CPU

3. Process can send a signal to another - Kernel can send signal to a process \(like an

   interrupt\)

4. A process can
   * ignore/discard the signal \(not possible with SIGKILL or SIGSTOP\) 
   * execute a signal handler function, and then possibly resume execution or terminate
   * carry out the default action for that signal

The common communication channel between user space program and kernel is given by the system calls. But there is a different channel, that of the signals, used both between user processes and from kernel to user process.

## 1. Sending signals

A program can signal a different program using the kill\(\) system call with prototype

```text
    int kill(pid_t pid, int sig);
```

This will send the signal with number sig to the process with process ID pid. Signal numbers are small positive integers. \(For the definitions on your machine, try /usr/include/bits/signum.h. Note that these definitions depend on OS and architecture.\)

A user can send a signal from the command line using the kill command. Common uses are kill -9 N to kill the process with pid N, or kill -1 N to force process N \(maybe init or inetd\) to reread its configuration file.

Certain user actions will make the kernel send a signal to a process or group of processes: typing the interrupt character \(probably Ctrl-C\) causes SIGINT to be sent, typing the quit character \(probably Ctrl-\) sends SIGQUIT, hanging up the phone \(modem\) sends SIGHUP, typing the stop character \(probably Ctrl-Z\) sends SIGSTOP.

Certain program actions will make the kernel send a signal to that process: for an illegal instruction one gets SIGILL, for accessing nonexisting memory one gets SIGSEGV, for writing to a pipe while nobody is listening anymore on the other side one gets SIGPIPE, for reading from the termnal while in the background one gets SIGTTIN, etc.

More interesting communication from the kernel is also possible. One can ask the kernel to be notified when something happens on a given file descriptor. See fcntl\(2\). And then there is ptrace\(2\) - see below.

A whole group of signals is reserved for real-time use.

## 2. Receiving signals

When a process receives a signal, a default action happens, unless the process has arranged to handle the signal. For the list of signals and the corresponding default actions, see signal\(7\). For example, by default SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGKILL will kill the process; SIGQUIT will kill the process and force a core dump; SIGSTOP, SIGTTIN will stop the process; SIGCONT will continue a stopped process; SIGCHLD will be ignored.

Traditionally, one sets up a handler for the signal using the signal system call with prototype

typedef void \(\*sighandler\_t\)\(int\); sighandler\_t signal\(int sig, sighandler\_t handler\); This sets up the routine handler\(\) as handler for signals with number sig. The return value is \(the address of\) the old handler. The special values SIG\_DFL and SIG\_IGN denote the default action and ignoring, respectively. When a signal arrives, the process is interrupted, the current registers are saved, and the signal handler is invoked. When the signal handler returns, the interrupted activity is continued.

It is difficult to do interesting things in a signal handler, because the process can be interrupted in an arbitrary place, data structures can be in arbitrary state, etc. The three most common things to do in a signal handler are \(i\) set a flag variable and return immediately, and \(ii\) \(messy\) throw away all the program was doing, and restart at some convenient point, perhaps the main command loop or so, and \(iii\) clean up and exit.

Setting up a handler for a signal is called "catching the signal". The signals SIGKILL and SIGSTOP cannot be caught or blocked or ignored.

## 3. Semantics

The traditional semantics was: reset signal behaviour to SIG\_DFL upon invocation of the signal handler. Possibly this was done to avoid recursive invocations. The signal handler would do its job and at the end call signal\(\) to establish itself again as handler.

This is really unfortunate. When two signals arrive shortly after each other, the second one will be lost if it arrives before the signal handler is called - there is no counter. And if it arrives after the signal handler is called, the default action will happen - this may very well kill the process. Even if the handler calls signal\(\) again as the very first thing it does, that may be too late.

Various Unix flavours played a bit with the semantics to improve on this situation. Some block signals as long as the process has not returned from the handler. The BSD solution was to invent a new system call, sigaction\(\) where one can precisely specify the desired behaviour. Today signal\(\) must be regarded as deprecated - not to be used in serious applications.

## 4. Blocking signals

Each process has a list \(bitmask\) of currently blocked signals. When a signal is blocked, it is not delivered \(that is, no signal handling routine is called\), but remains pending.

The sigprocmask\(\) system call serves to change the list of blocked signals. See sigprocmask\(2\).

The sigpending\(\) system call reveals what signals are \(blocked and\) pending.

The sigsuspend\(\) system call suspends the calling process until a specified signal is received.

When a signal is blocked, it remains pending, even when otherwise the process would ignore it.

## 5. Voodoo: wait and SIGCHLD

When a process forks off a child to perform some task, it is probably interested in how things went. Upon exit, the child leaves an exit status that should be returned to the parent. So, when the child finishes it becomes a zombie - a process that is dead already but does not disappear yet because it has not yet reported its exit status.

Whenever something interesting happens to the child \(it exits, crashes, traps, stops, continues\), and in particular when it dies, the parent is sent a SIGCHLD signal.

The parent can use the system call wait\(\) or waitpid\(\) or so, there are a few variations, to learn about the status of its stopped or deceased children. In the case of a deceased child, as soon as a status has been reported, the zombie vanishes.

If the parent is not interested it can say so explicitly \(before the fork\) using

signal\(SIGCHLD, SIG\_IGN\); or struct sigaction act; act.sa\_handler = something; act.sa\_flags = SA\_NOCLDWAIT; sigaction \(SIGCHLD, &act, NULL\); and as a result it will not hear about deceased children, and children will not be transformed into zombies. Note that the default action for SIGCHLD is to ignore this signal; nevertheless signal\(SIGCHLD, SIG\_IGN\) has effect, namely that of preventing the transformation of children into zombies. In this situation, if the parent does a wait\(\), this call will return only when all children have exited, and then returns -1 with errno set to ECHILD. It depends on the Unix flavor whether SIGCHLD is sent when SA\_NOCLDWAIT was set. After act.sa\_flags = SA\_NOCLDSTOP no SIGCHLD is sent when children stop or stopped children continue.

If the parent exits before the child, then the child is reparented to init, process 1, and this process will reap its status.

## 6. Returning from a signal handler

When the program was interrupted by a signal, its status \(including all integer and floating point registers\) was saved, to be restored just before execution continues at the point of interruption.

This means that the return from the signal handler is more complicated than an arbitrary procedure return - the saved state must be restored.

To this end, the kernel arranges that the return from the signal handler causes a jump to a short code sequence \(sometimes called trampoline\) that executes a sigreturn\(\) system call. This system call takes care of everything.

In the old days the trampoline lived on the stack, but nowadays \(since 2.5.69\) we have a trampoline in the vsyscall page, so that this trampoline no longer is an obstacle in case one wants a non-executable stack.

## 7. ptrace

For debugging purposes, the ptrace\(\) system call was introduced. A process can trace a different process, examine or change its memory, see the system calls done or change them, etc. The way this is implemented is that the tracing process is notified each time the traced process does something interesting. Always interesting is the reception of signals. When the tracing process specifies this, also excution of system calls, or execution of any instruction is interesting.

Thus, one has interactive debuggers like gdb, and tracers like strace. This call is also very useful for hacking purposes. One can make one's own program attach to some utility and subtly change its workings, while the binary of the utility is unchanged, still has the correct date stamps and md5sum.

Exercise Write a program that attaches itself to a process with specified pid, and watches its read\(\) calls; whenever a specified string occurs, change it into something else. Be otherwise invisible.

Exercise Write a program that attaches itself to a shell and watches the commands given. Whenever a specified binary must be executed, execute a different specified binary instead. Be otherwise invisible.

Below a baby example of the use of ptrace. This program will list the system calls done by some existing process \(call ./ptrace -p N\) or some subprocess \(call ./ptrace some\_command, e.g., ./ptrace /bin/ls -l\). The version below will work only on i386, and only for relatively recent kernels.

A tracee gets sent a SIGTRAP signal \(and stops\) when it successfully does an execve system call. This means that we see execve three times \(on exit, on return, on SIGTRAP\). This signal can be used to synchronize on, instead of the above complicated SIGUSR1 construction.

## 8. The Linux "parent death" signal

For each process there is a variable pdeath\_signal, that is initialized to 0 after fork\(\) or clone\(\). It gives the signal that the process should get when its parent dies.

This variable can be set using

```text
        prctl(PR_SET_PDEATHSIG, sig);
```

and read out using

```text
        prctl(PR_GET_PDEATHSIG, &sig);
```

This construct can be used in thread libraries: when the manager thread dies, all threads managed by it should clean up and exit. E.g.:

```text
        prctl(PR_SET_PDEATHSIG, SIGHUP);        /* set pdeath sig */
        if (getppid() == 1)                     /* parent died already? */
                kill(getpid(), SIGHUP);
```
