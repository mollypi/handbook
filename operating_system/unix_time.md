# Unix time

Unix time \(also known as POSIX time or Epoch time\) is a system for describing instants in time, defined as the number of seconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 Coordinated Universal Time \(UTC\), Thursday, 1 January 1970,\[1\]\[note 1\] not counting leap seconds.\[1\]\[2\]\[note 2\] It is used widely in Unix-like and many other operating systems and file formats. Because it does not handle leap seconds, it is neither a linear representation of time nor a true representation of UTC.\[note 3\] Unix time may be checked on most Unix systems by typing `date +%s` on the command line.
