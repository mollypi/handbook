# Threading

The threading module builds on the low-level features of thread to make working with threads even easier and more pythonic. Using threads allows a program to run multiple operations concurrently in the same process space.

Thread Objects

The simplest way to use a Thread is to instantiate it with a target function and call start\(\) to let it begin working.

```text
import threading

def worker():
    """thread worker function"""
    print 'Worker'
    return

threads = []
for i in range(5):
    t = threading.Thread(target=worker)
    threads.append(t)
    t.start()
```

The output is five lines with "Worker" on each:

```text
$ python threading_simple.py

Worker
Worker
Worker
Worker
Worker
```

It useful to be able to spawn a thread and pass it arguments to tell it what work to do. This example passes a number, which the thread then prints.

```text
import threading

def worker(num):
    """thread worker function"""
    print 'Worker: %s' % num
    return

threads = []
for i in range(5):
    t = threading.Thread(target=worker, args=(i,))
    threads.append(t)
    t.start()
```

The integer argument is now included in the message printed by each thread:

```text
$ python -u threading_simpleargs.py

Worker: 0
Worker: 1
Worker: 2
Worker: 3
Worker: 4
```

Daemon vs. Non-Daemon Threads

Up to this point, the example programs have implicitly waited to exit until all threads have completed their work.

Sometimes programs spawn a thread as a daemon that runs without blocking the main program from exiting. Using daemon threads is useful for services where there may not be an easy way to interrupt the thread or where letting the thread die in the middle of its work does not lose or corrupt data \(for example, a thread that generates “heart beats” for a service monitoring tool\).

To mark a thread as a daemon, call its setDaemon\(\) method with a boolean argument. The default is for threads to not be daemons, so passing True turns the daemon mode on.

```text
import threading
import time
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG,
                    format='(%(threadName)-10s) %(message)s',
                    )

def daemon():
    logging.debug('Starting')
    time.sleep(2)
    logging.debug('Exiting')

d = threading.Thread(name='daemon', target=daemon)
d.setDaemon(True)

def non_daemon():
    logging.debug('Starting')
    logging.debug('Exiting')

t = threading.Thread(name='non-daemon', target=non_daemon)

d.start()
t.start()
```

Notice that the output does not include the "Exiting" message from the daemon thread, since all of the non-daemon threads \(including the main thread\) exit before the daemon thread wakes up from its two second sleep.

```text
$ python threading_daemon.py

(daemon    ) Starting
(non-daemon) Starting
(non-daemon) Exiting
```

To wait until a daemon thread has completed its work, use the join\(\) method.

```text
import threading
import time
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG,
                    format='(%(threadName)-10s) %(message)s',
                    )

def daemon():
    logging.debug('Starting')
    time.sleep(2)
    logging.debug('Exiting')

d = threading.Thread(name='daemon', target=daemon)
d.setDaemon(True)

def non_daemon():
    logging.debug('Starting')
    logging.debug('Exiting')

t = threading.Thread(name='non-daemon', target=non_daemon)

d.start()
t.start()

d.join()
t.join()
```

Waiting for the daemon thread to exit using join\(\) means it has a chance to produce its "Exiting" message.

```text
$ python threading_daemon_join.py

(daemon    ) Starting
(non-daemon) Starting
(non-daemon) Exiting
(daemon    ) Exiting
```

By default, join\(\) blocks indefinitely. It is also possible to pass a timeout argument \(a float representing the number of seconds to wait for the thread to become inactive\). If the thread does not complete within the timeout period, join\(\) returns anyway.

```text
import threading
import time
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG,
                    format='(%(threadName)-10s) %(message)s',
                    )

def daemon():
    logging.debug('Starting')
    time.sleep(2)
    logging.debug('Exiting')

d = threading.Thread(name='daemon', target=daemon)
d.setDaemon(True)

def non_daemon():
    logging.debug('Starting')
    logging.debug('Exiting')

t = threading.Thread(name='non-daemon', target=non_daemon)

d.start()
t.start()

d.join(1)
print 'd.isAlive()', d.isAlive()
t.join()
```

Since the timeout passed is less than the amount of time the daemon thread sleeps, the thread is still “alive” after join\(\) returns.

```text
$ python threading_daemon_join_timeout.py

(daemon    ) Starting
(non-daemon) Starting
(non-daemon) Exiting
d.isAlive() True
```

Signaling Between Threads

Although the point of using multiple threads is to spin separate operations off to run concurrently, there are times when it is important to be able to synchronize the operations in two or more threads.

A simple way to communicate between threads is using Event objects. An Event manages an internal flag that callers can either set\(\) or clear\(\). Other threads can wait\(\) for the flag to be set\(\), effectively blocking progress until allowed to continue.

```text
import logging
import threading
import time

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG,
                    format='(%(threadName)-10s) %(message)s',
                    )

def wait_for_event(e):
    """Wait for the event to be set before doing anything"""
    logging.debug('wait_for_event starting')
    event_is_set = e.wait()
    logging.debug('event set: %s', event_is_set)

def wait_for_event_timeout(e, t):
    """Wait t seconds and then timeout"""
    while not e.isSet():
        logging.debug('wait_for_event_timeout starting')
        event_is_set = e.wait(t)
        logging.debug('event set: %s', event_is_set)
        if event_is_set:
            logging.debug('processing event')
        else:
            logging.debug('doing other work')


e = threading.Event()
t1 = threading.Thread(name='block', 
                      target=wait_for_event,
                      args=(e,))
t1.start()

t2 = threading.Thread(name='non-block', 
                      target=wait_for_event_timeout, 
                      args=(e, 2))
t2.start()

logging.debug('Waiting before calling Event.set()')
time.sleep(3)
e.set()
logging.debug('Event is set')
```

The wait\(\) method takes an argument representing the number of seconds to wait for the event before timing out. It returns a boolean indicating whether or not the event is set, so the caller knows why wait\(\) returned. The isSet\(\) method can be used separately on the event without fear of blocking.

In this example, wait\_for\_event\_timeout\(\) checks the event status without blocking indefinitely. The wait\_for\_event\(\) blocks on the call to wait\(\), which does not return until the event status changes.

```text
$ python threading_event.py

(block     ) wait_for_event starting
(non-block ) wait_for_event_timeout starting
(MainThread) Waiting before calling Event.set()
(non-block ) event set: False
(non-block ) doing other work
(non-block ) wait_for_event_timeout starting
(MainThread) Event is set
(block     ) event set: True
(non-block ) event set: True
(non-block ) processing event
```
