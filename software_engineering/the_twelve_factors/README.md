# The Twelve Factors

## [I. Codebase](https://github.com/mollypi/site-reliability-engineer-handbook/tree/ba847bfb6a351eac14a0bf1f23b13fa51652f83b/codebase/README.md)

### One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys

## [II. Dependencies](https://github.com/mollypi/site-reliability-engineer-handbook/tree/ba847bfb6a351eac14a0bf1f23b13fa51652f83b/dependencies/README.md)

### Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies

## [III. Config](https://github.com/mollypi/site-reliability-engineer-handbook/tree/ba847bfb6a351eac14a0bf1f23b13fa51652f83b/config/README.md)

### Store config in the environment

## [IV. Backing Services](https://github.com/mollypi/site-reliability-engineer-handbook/tree/ba847bfb6a351eac14a0bf1f23b13fa51652f83b/backing-services/README.md)

### Treat backing services as attached resources

## [V. Build, release, run](https://github.com/mollypi/site-reliability-engineer-handbook/tree/ba847bfb6a351eac14a0bf1f23b13fa51652f83b/build-release-run/README.md)

### Strictly separate build and run stages

## [VI. Processes](https://github.com/mollypi/site-reliability-engineer-handbook/tree/ba847bfb6a351eac14a0bf1f23b13fa51652f83b/processes/README.md)

### Execute the app as one or more stateless processes

## [VII. Port binding](https://github.com/mollypi/site-reliability-engineer-handbook/tree/ba847bfb6a351eac14a0bf1f23b13fa51652f83b/port-binding/README.md)

### Export services via port binding

## [VIII. Concurrency](https://github.com/mollypi/site-reliability-engineer-handbook/tree/ba847bfb6a351eac14a0bf1f23b13fa51652f83b/concurrency/README.md)

### Scale out via the process model

## [IX. Disposability](https://github.com/mollypi/site-reliability-engineer-handbook/tree/ba847bfb6a351eac14a0bf1f23b13fa51652f83b/disposability/README.md)

### Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown

## [X. Dev/prod parity](https://github.com/mollypi/site-reliability-engineer-handbook/tree/ba847bfb6a351eac14a0bf1f23b13fa51652f83b/dev-prod-parity/README.md)

### Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible

## [XI. Logs](https://github.com/mollypi/site-reliability-engineer-handbook/tree/ba847bfb6a351eac14a0bf1f23b13fa51652f83b/logs/README.md)

### Treat logs as event streams

## [XII. Admin processes](https://github.com/mollypi/site-reliability-engineer-handbook/tree/ba847bfb6a351eac14a0bf1f23b13fa51652f83b/admin-processes/README.md)

### Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes
