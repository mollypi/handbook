# Expose Docker Remote API on CentOS

We came to install Docker on CentOS easily. Here is an instruction for the way to expose Docker remote API port on CentOS.

```text
$ cat /etc/sysconfig/docker
other_args=""
```

Edit the file /etc/sysconfig/docker as below.

```text
other_args="-H tcp://0.0.0.0:4243 -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
```

After that, restart docker and try to access the host from another host.

```text
$ sudo /etc/init.d/docker restart
...
$ curl $hostname:4243/images/json
...
```

I think docker is almost practical for production environment since it cames to run on CentOS.
